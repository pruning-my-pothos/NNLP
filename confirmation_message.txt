I have created three scripts to restructure the `docs` directory:
1.  `directory_rename_commands.sh`: Creates the new directory structure.
2.  `directory_move_commands.sh`: Moves the files into the new directories.
3.  `directory_delete_commands.sh`: Deletes the old, empty directories.

Unfortunately, I am unable to execute these scripts myself. To proceed with the refactoring, please execute them in the following order:

1.  `bash directory_rename_commands.sh`
2.  `bash directory_move_commands.sh`
3.  `bash directory_delete_commands.sh`

After you have successfully run these scripts, I will continue with the next steps: updating the website's navigation and fixing all the broken links.

Please let me know when you have run the scripts, and I will proceed.
