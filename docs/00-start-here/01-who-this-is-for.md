# Who This Is For

:::info[The Core Promise]
NNLP is for people who want the speed of GenAI **without giving up clarity, correctness, or responsibility.**
:::

NNLP is designed for professionals who work at the intersection of **thinking, language, and systems** and who want AI to amplify their work without eroding responsibility.

---

## Primary Audience

### Builders and Engineers

You write or review code, design systems, or maintain production software.

NNLP is for you if:

- you use AI to scaffold, refactor, debug, or document
- you care about **correctness, maintainability, and reviewability**
- you want AI to accelerate execution, not replace judgment

NNLP helps you:

- turn vague requirements into **executable intent**
- control scope and delegation
- reduce regressions from AI-generated changes

---

### Product and UX Practitioners

You translate user needs into specifications, requirements, and roadmaps.

NNLP is for you if:

- you work with ambiguous problem statements
- you collaborate with engineering teams
- you need artifacts that survive handoff and iteration

NNLP helps you:

- write clearer problem statements and acceptance criteria
- align stakeholders around explicit trade-offs
- reduce interpretation drift between intent and delivery

---

### Documentation, Enablement, and Comms

You produce technical documentation, runbooks, onboarding material, or internal communication.

NNLP is for you if:

- you already think carefully about language
- you are adopting AI-assisted writing or docs-as-code
- you need **accuracy and consistency**, not just speed

NNLP helps you:

- treat documentation as an executable asset
- reduce hallucinations and factual drift
- maintain trust with readers and users

---

### Tech Leads, Architects, and Platform Owners

You are responsible for system integrity, risk, and long-term outcomes.

NNLP is for you if:

- you evaluate AI usage across teams
- you worry about governance, safety, and maintainability
- you want repeatable patterns, not hero workflows

NNLP helps you:

- establish **guardrails and working agreements**
- evaluate AI-assisted outputs systematically
- balance velocity with responsibility

---

## Secondary Audience

### Solo Builders and Indie Hackers

You move fast, often alone, and rely heavily on AI tools.

NNLP is useful if:

- you want fewer rewrites and dead ends
- you care about shipping something solid, not just something fast
- you want habits that scale if your project grows

### Learners Transitioning Into AI-Assisted Work

You may be new to GenAI but serious about using it professionally.

NNLP is appropriate if:

- you are willing to learn fundamentals
- you want to avoid shallow prompt-driven habits
- you prefer structure over shortcuts

---

## Who This Is Not For

NNLP is likely not a good fit if:

- you want one-line prompts and instant results
- you seek no-code automation without understanding systems
- you are unwilling to review or validate AI outputs
- you see AI as a replacement for thinking

NNLP assumes:

- responsibility matters
- correctness matters
- language has consequences

---

## Required Mindset

To practice NNLP effectively, you must be willing to:

- slow down before generating
- write and revise intent explicitly
- accept that ambiguity is a defect
- treat language as part of the system
- remain accountable for outcomes

If this mindset aligns with how you work or how you want to work, NNLP will compound your effectiveness.
