| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **00 · Handbook Introduction** | What this handbook is, who it serves, scope, prerequisites, style, glossary, map. | New readers; anyone orienting. |
| **01 · Handbook Method** | Core loop, artifacts (intent/constraints/delegation), techniques (prompting, RAG), evaluation. | Practitioners running AI-assisted work; leads setting process. |
| **02 · Execution Patterns** | Recipes for common tasks (scaffold, refactor, debug, docs, releases). | Engineers/tech writers applying the method day-to-day. |
| **03 · Professional Scenarios** | Role- and domain-focused case studies. | PMs, leads, cross-functional partners. |
| **04 · Tooling & Frameworks** | IDE/CLI workflows, LLM orchestration frameworks, local-first inference. | Engineers choosing tools; enablement teams. |
| **05 · Responsible AI** | Safety, bias, privacy, governance, red teaming. | Security/compliance, leads, anyone shipping AI features. |
| **Foundations (Reference)** | GenAI/LLM theory, NLP basics, sequential models, transformers. | Readers needing background or refreshers. |
